# Supply_Chain_Management
This project implements a Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Tracking System using Python. It simulates the journey of products through different supply chain stages (e.g., farm, warehouse, customer), records each step on a blockchain, and allows exporting the full chain to an Excel file for transparency and analysis.
